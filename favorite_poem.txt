Like all his people he felt at home in the forest. 
The silence beneath great trees, the dimness there, 
The distant high rustling of foliage, the clumps 
Of fern like little green fountains, patches of sunlight, 
Patches of moss and lichen, the occasional 
Undergrowth of hazel and holly, was he aware 
Of all this? On the contrary his unawareness 
Was a kind of gratification, a sense of comfort

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I love french fries
As much as I love you!
